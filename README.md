## Just a Tumble-dryer Timer

*My tumble dryer broke, and I'm too tight to buy a new one.*

...so I designed a timer that bettered the simple mechanical one it used to sport.  Now I have everything I could want from it except I keep changing my mind, so basically, it's my toy now.  It has adjustable pre-set heating and cooling, offers resume for when you open the door, and through the magic of interlocking design with the power board and door switch, physically CANNOT run unless the door is shut, nor run the heater if the motor isn't running.

What this will *NEVER* be:-
* On the internet
* Remote controlled (These things need to be in some way supervised)
* Need an app to operate (YUK!)

Still to do:-

- [ ] Document the code.
- [ ] Publish the 3D CAD models and .STL files for the timer enclosure.
- [ ] Add a beeper to notify completion.
- [ ] Add a pre-set Jeans, delicates, & Towels program.
- [ ] Consider auto-power adjust.
- [ ] Consider humidity sensing operation.
